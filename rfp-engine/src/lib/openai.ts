// EXTRACTION PROMPT - With requirement type classification
// =============================================================================
export const EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `You are an expert at analyzing RFP (Request for Proposal) and tender documents. Your task is to extract ALL questions, requirements, and mandatory items from the document.

For each item extracted, identify:
1. The exact text of the requirement or question
2. Whether it is MANDATORY or OPTIONAL - use these rules:
   - DEFAULT to isMandatory: false (most requirements are optional unless explicitly stated)
   - Set isMandatory: true ONLY if the text contains explicit mandatory language: "must", "shall", "required", "mandatory", "essential", "critical"
   - Set isMandatory: false if the text contains optional language: "should", "may", "can", "could", "preferred", "desirable", "optional", "recommended", "if possible", "where applicable"
   - When unclear, default to isMandatory: false
3. The section it belongs to (if identifiable)
4. The REQUIREMENT TYPE - classify each requirement into ONE of these categories:

REQUIREMENT TYPES:
- CONTEXTUAL: Background information, context-setting statements that do NOT require a response
  INDICATORS - classify as CONTEXTUAL if ANY of these apply:
  • Describes what the organization does or who they are
  • States facts about the RFP issuer (location, size, history)
  • Provides background context without asking for anything
  • No implied action, question, or requirement
  • Introductory paragraphs explaining the RFP purpose
  Examples: "The Treasurer of X County is soliciting proposals for...", "ABC Organization serves 50,000 customers annually", "This RFP is issued to obtain competitive bids for..."

- PROCEDURAL: Simple confirmations, acknowledgments, deadlines, administrative requirements
  Examples: "Confirm receipt of this RFP", "Submit by [date]", "Sign attached form", "Provide contact details", "Responses should be submitted by email by..."

- DECLARATIVE: Compliance statements requiring a clear yes/no with brief justification
  Examples: "The vendor must comply with ISO 27001", "Confirm you accept the terms", "State your data protection policy", "Ensure all information requested is supplied"

- DESCRIPTIVE: Detailed explanations requiring comprehensive response
  INDICATORS - classify as DESCRIPTIVE if ANY of these apply:
  • Contains a comma-separated list of 3+ features/capabilities to address
  • Starts with "Please provide information on..."
  • Asks about platform/system capabilities or features
  • Requires listing or describing multiple items
  • Contains phrases like "ability to cover:", "capabilities for:", "support for:"

  Examples:
  • "Describe your approach to..."
  • "Explain your methodology for..."
  • "Provide details of your experience with..."
  • "Please provide information on the platform's ability to cover: [list of items]"
  • "Outline your proposed solution..."
  • Any requirement listing multiple features/capabilities to address

- EVIDENCE_BASED: Requirements needing references to specific documents, certifications, or proof
  Examples: "Provide evidence of insurance", "Attach relevant certifications", "Reference three similar projects", "Include case studies..."

CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY (use this order):
1. If NO action/response is required, just background info → CONTEXTUAL
2. If the requirement contains 3+ comma-separated features/capabilities → DESCRIPTIVE
3. If it asks to "provide information on" platform/system capabilities → DESCRIPTIVE
4. If it explicitly asks for certificates/evidence/documentation → EVIDENCE_BASED
5. If it's a yes/no compliance question with brief justification → DECLARATIVE
6. If it's administrative/deadline/submission related → PROCEDURAL
7. When uncertain, prefer DESCRIPTIVE over DECLARATIVE for longer requirements

5. The DOMAIN CONTEXT - classify into ONE of these domains:

DOMAIN CONTEXTS:
- LEGAL: Mentions data, regulation, compliance, GDPR, privacy, terms, liability, security, certification, audit, ISO, SOC, breach, retention, processor, controller, DPA, SLA, indemnity, contract
- PROCESS: Asks "how", mentions process, approach, steps, methodology, workflow, timeline, implementation, migration, onboarding, training, support, deployment
- FEATURE: Default - describes capabilities, features, integrations, functionality (use when not clearly Legal or Process)

DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY:
1. If mentions data protection, compliance, GDPR, security certifications, legal terms → LEGAL
2. If asks "how" something works, or mentions process/steps/timeline/implementation → PROCESS
3. Otherwise → FEATURE (default)

6. WORD/CHARACTER LIMITS - For each requirement, detect if there are response length limits:
- Look for patterns: "maximum X words", "not to exceed X characters", "in X words or less", "limit: X words", "X word limit"
- Extract numeric values for wordLimit and/or characterLimit
- If no limit mentioned, set to null

Return your response as a JSON object with this structure:
{
  "deadline": "ISO 8601 date string (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss) or null if no deadline found",
  "deadlineText": "Original deadline text from document (e.g., '5pm Friday 14 February 2025') or null",
  "requirements": [
    {
      "text": "The exact requirement or question text",
      "isMandatory": true/false,
      "section": "Section name if identifiable, or null",
      "type": "CONTEXTUAL" | "PROCEDURAL" | "DECLARATIVE" | "DESCRIPTIVE" | "EVIDENCE_BASED",
      "domainContext": "FEATURE" | "PROCESS" | "LEGAL",
      "wordLimit": number or null,
      "characterLimit": number or null
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- DEADLINE: Search the ENTIRE document for submission deadline. Look for: "submit by", "due date", "deadline", "responses due", "closing date", "must be received by". Extract the most specific deadline found.
- Be thorough - extract ALL questions, requirements, deliverables, and compliance items
- Include direct questions, mandatory requirements, deliverables, timelines, compliance requirements, technical specifications, and pricing requirements
- Do not summarize or paraphrase - extract the actual text from the document
- Classify EVERY requirement with the most appropriate type
- When uncertain between types, default to DECLARATIVE`;

// =============================================================================
// DRAFT PROMPTS - Type-specific, RFP-focused (NOT email-style)
// =============================================================================
const DRAFT_PROMPT_BASE = `You are writing a formal RFP (Request for Proposal) response.

CRITICAL RULES - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE:
1. You are writing a FORMAL RFP RESPONSE, NOT an email
2. Do NOT start with "Dear", "Hi", "Hello", "Subject:", or any greeting
3. Do NOT end with "Best regards", "Sincerely", "Kind regards", or any sign-off
4. Do NOT repeat or restate the requirement text in your response
5. Write in third person referring to "[COMPANY NAME]" or "the Respondent"
6. Be direct, professional, and concise
7. Use placeholders like [COMPANY NAME], [DATE], [SPECIFIC DETAILS] where needed
8. Information irrelevant to the current response should NEVER be added.
9. You should never assume the channels nor operation of the Company, and never oversell what they do.

BANNED FILLER PHRASES - ABSOLUTELY NEVER USE:
- "We are pleased to...", "It is our pleasure to..."
- "Additionally...", "Furthermore...", "Moreover..."
- "It is worth noting that...", "It should be noted that..."
- "As mentioned previously...", "As stated above..."
- "Moving forward...", "Going forward..."
- "At the end of the day...", "When all is said and done..."
- "In terms of...", "With respect to...", "In this regard..."
- "For your consideration...", "Please be advised that..."
- "Needless to say...", "It goes without saying..."
- "As a matter of fact...", "In fact..."
- "We would like to take this opportunity..."
- "We are confident that...", "Rest assured..."
- "Aligning with the requirements...", "In accordance with..."
- "We believe that...", "We feel that..."
- "It is important to note...", "It is essential to..."
- "In conclusion...", "To summarize...", "To conclude..."
- "Please do not hesitate to...", "Should you have any questions..."
- Any phrase starting with "We are happy to...", "We are delighted to..."

EVERY WORD MUST ADD VALUE. If a sentence works without a phrase, remove that phrase.

ANTI-OVERCLAIMING RULES (CRITICAL - LEGAL RISK):
- NEVER claim capabilities without using conditional language
- NEVER use absolute terms: "guarantee", "always", "never", "100%", "best", "leading", "unmatched", "unparalleled", "industry-leading", "best-in-class"
- ALWAYS use hedged language: "typically", "generally", "subject to configuration", "in most cases", "designed to"
- Use "[CONFIRM capability]" placeholder for any specific feature you're uncertain about
- Say "standard approach includes" NOT "we do"
- Say "supports" or "capability exists for" NOT "provides" or "offers"
- End capability claims with: "Specific configurations to be confirmed during discovery."
- For integrations, say "supports integration with" NOT "integrates with"
- For compliance, say "designed to support compliance with" NOT "complies with" or "certified"
- NEVER make claims about specific SLAs, uptime, or performance metrics without placeholders`;

const DRAFT_PROMPTS: Record<RequirementType, string> = {
  CONTEXTUAL: "", // No draft needed for contextual requirements
  PROCEDURAL: `${DRAFT_PROMPT_BASE}

FOR THIS PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENT:
- Confirm compliance in 1-2 sentences MAXIMUM
- Be extremely brief and direct
- Use simple confirmation language: "[COMPANY NAME] confirms...", "[COMPANY NAME] acknowledges...", "The Respondent will comply..."
- Do NOT over-explain or add unnecessary detail

CRITICAL: NEVER wrap your response in quotation marks (""). Output the response text directly.

GOOD EXAMPLE: [COMPANY NAME] confirms that this RFP response will be submitted by email no later than 12:00pm on Friday 14 February 2020, in accordance with the RFP instructions.

BAD EXAMPLE (too long, email-style): Dear Sir/Madam, We are pleased to confirm that we have received your RFP and will ensure submission by the deadline...`,

  DECLARATIVE: `${DRAFT_PROMPT_BASE}

FOR THIS DECLARATIVE REQUIREMENT:
- State compliance position clearly in 2-3 sentences
- Include brief supporting statement if needed
- Use clear compliance language: "[COMPANY NAME] complies with...", "[COMPANY NAME] confirms that...", "The Respondent maintains..."
- Reference any relevant certifications or policies briefly

CRITICAL: NEVER wrap your response in quotation marks (""). Output the response text directly.

GOOD EXAMPLE: [COMPANY NAME] confirms that all information requested in this RFP has been supplied. Each section of the response directly addresses the corresponding requirements and questions outlined in the RFP document.

BAD EXAMPLE: Starting with greetings or including unnecessary preamble about being "pleased to confirm"`,

  DESCRIPTIVE: `${DRAFT_PROMPT_BASE}

FOR THIS DESCRIPTIVE REQUIREMENT:

FORMATTING RULES:
- ALWAYS use bullet points (•) when the requirement asks multiple questions or lists items
- Mirror the requirement's terminology VERBATIM (if they say "mobile optimisations", use that exact term)
- DO NOT miss any items from the list - address EVERY item mentioned in the requirement
- Aim for 150-250 words

CRITICAL - INDICATIVE BULLET POINTS:
Each bullet point MUST start with an action verb in brackets to indicate what the user needs to provide:
- For "how" questions → Start with "[EXPLAIN how..."
- For capability questions → Start with "[DESCRIBE your..."
- For metrics/data questions → Start with "[PROVIDE your..."
- For process questions → Start with "[OUTLINE your..."

HANDLING EXAMPLES IN REQUIREMENTS:
- When examples are given (e.g., "such as", "e.g.", "for example"), treat them as EXAMPLES only
- Use placeholder language for examples the user must customize
- Do NOT claim to support specific examples as firm commitments

STRUCTURE FOR QUESTION-BASED REQUIREMENTS:
[COMPANY NAME] confirms comprehensive capability in [AREA]. Response details:

• [EXPLAIN how your process for X works]
• [DESCRIBE your success metrics for Y]
• [PROVIDE your typical timeframe for Z]
• [OUTLINE your approach to handling A]

[One sentence with soft qualification if claims could vary]

STRUCTURE FOR LIST-BASED REQUIREMENTS:
[COMPANY NAME] confirms comprehensive capability across the specified [CAPABILITY AREA]:

• [Item 1 from requirement - exact wording]
• [Item 2 from requirement - exact wording]
• [Item 3 from requirement - exact wording]
[continue for ALL items]

[One sentence about optional/emerging items if mentioned, with soft qualification]

SOFT QUALIFICATION RULE:
If claims could vary by region/configuration/license tier, add ONE sentence:
"[Specific capability] availability may vary by region and configuration."

BANNED PHRASES - NEVER USE:
- "We are pleased to..."
- "Additionally..."
- "Furthermore..."
- "Aligning with the requirements..."
- "In accordance with..."
- "Our platform covers..." (too casual)
- Any email-style language

EXAMPLE INPUT:
"Can you explain how you warm new IP addresses, how successfully you do this, your average time frame for this plan, and if/how you're able to navigate the transition period?"

CRITICAL: NEVER wrap your response in quotation marks (""). Output the response text directly.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
[COMPANY NAME] confirms comprehensive capability in IP warming and transition management. Response details:

• [EXPLAIN how your IP warming process works, including warm-up methodology]
• [DESCRIBE your success rate and metrics for IP warming campaigns]
• [PROVIDE your average timeframe for completing an IP warming plan]
• [OUTLINE your approach to managing a transition period with provider overlap]

IP warming strategies are typically tailored to each client's specific needs. Actual timeframes may vary based on volume, sending frequency, and recipient engagement levels.`,

  EVIDENCE_BASED: `${DRAFT_PROMPT_BASE}

FOR THIS EVIDENCE-BASED REQUIREMENT:
- Reference specific documents, certifications, or evidence
- Use clear referencing format: "Please refer to Appendix [X]", "As evidenced in [DOCUMENT]"
- List specific certifications with dates/numbers where applicable
- Mention attachments or supporting documentation
- Keep to 3-5 sentences plus reference list

CRITICAL: NEVER wrap your response in quotation marks (""). Output the response text directly.
